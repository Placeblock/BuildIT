Throughout the project the Observer pattern is used extensively.

I have done this because it has proven to be the most flexible, reusable and extensible so far.

My Observer pattern does not only observe for changes, but the subjects can pass data to the observing observers.
This data is called an "Event" in this application.

This directory contains events (structs) for all events used in the application.
