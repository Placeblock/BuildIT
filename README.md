## BuildIT - Build it yourself!

A simple, powerful and FAST application for simulating logic gates written 
from scratch in pure C++ using opengl.

For a long time I wished I had an application for building anything I wanted.
Maybe a calculator, maybe some games. I come from a Minecraft background and 
redstone always inspired me to get creative. You just place blocks and create.
The only drawback of redstone is that it is relatively slow. That is why I
started this project. My goal was to create an application to be creative, one
that allows me to experiment, learn, have fun! Enter BuildIT - 
an application for simulating logic gates. With BuildIT you can create anything
up to the limits of your imagination (and your computer). It is capable of showing
you every single calculation that is done to really understand what is going on
under the hood. On the other hand you can calculate hundreds of millions gates per
second.
